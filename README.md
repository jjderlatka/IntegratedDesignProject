There are four branches - `main`, `Mechanics`, `Electronics` and `Software`. You can see them and switch at the top:

Upload your work to correct folder, but also on the correct branch - if you are uploading to 'Mechanics', make sure you are on the 'Mechanics' branch. `main` is a protected branch - you can't upload to it directly. Everything needs to be uploaded to a different branch (eg. `Mechanics`) and then this branch can be merged into `main` once reviewed and approved by someone else.
